Here are a few software that I am developping for analysis and modelling of GNSS data.
They are in a development stage and I am planning to make them progressively available.


Have a look at my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/JMNocquet) or [contact me](mailto:nocquet@geoazur.unice.fr) if you are interested in using the software.

* PYACS

PYACS is a set of tools that allow:
- Producing time series from free solutions
- Do time series analysis
- Do basic horizontal velocity fields analysis (Euler poles, strain rate maps)

See [pyacs documentation](https://jmnocquet.github.io/docs/)
