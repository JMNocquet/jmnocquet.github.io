I am a researcher from the French National Institute for Sustainable Development ([IRD](https://en.ird.fr/)). I work at [Geoazur](https://geoazur.oca.eu)
and [IPGP](http://www.ipgp.fr).

Research interests
======

I use spatial geodesy to understand the short term behaviour of faults, before, during and after earthquakes.
