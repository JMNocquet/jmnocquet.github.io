I am a researcher from the French National Institute for Sustainable Development ([IRD](https://en.ird.fr/)). I work at [Geoazur](https://geoazur.oca.eu)
and [IPGP](http://www.ipgp.fr).

Research interests
======

I use spatial geodesy to understand the short term behaviour of faults, before, during and after earthquakes.

Current Projects
======
* ANR funded S5 project: Slow Slip Events and Seismic Swarms in South America
* ANR funded REMAKE project


Software
======
Here are a few software you might be interested in:
* [PYACS] (https://github.com/jmnocquet/pyacs): a python library for time GNSS time series generation and analysis
* PYEQ: some modelling tools for earthquakes and geodesy
